# Interactive Guided Tour Verification Report

## Scope

Verified the first-login guided tour implementation for the admin dashboard, including the create-key, signer pool, and billing configuration touchpoints.

## Executed Checks

- `cd /Users/Michael/fluid/admin-dashboard && node --test --experimental-strip-types lib/admin-guided-tour.test.ts verification/InteractiveGuidedTour.integration.test.ts`
- Result: passed (`6` tests, `0` failures)

## Browser Verification

- Browser preview opened from `verification/interactive-guided-tour-preview.html`
- Screenshot captured for the first tour step showing the spotlight and onboarding card

## Notes

- A direct Next.js dev-server run was not possible in this workspace because the admin-dashboard package dependencies are not installed locally and the package install path is blocked by an existing invalid dependency range (`i18next@^4.4.0`).
- The implementation itself is fully wired in `app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` and `components/dashboard/AdminGuidedTour.tsx`.
