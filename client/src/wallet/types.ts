/**
 * Universal wallet signing types for the Fluid client.
 *
 * These types describe a wallet-agnostic signing contract that example
 * applications can target regardless of how the underlying wallet is
 * delivered (browser extension, WalletConnect, in-memory keypair, …).
 *
 * The shape intentionally mirrors the de-facto Stellar standard wallet
 * interface (SEP-43): `signTransaction(xdr, opts)` resolves to an object that
 * carries the signed transaction envelope plus the address that signed it.
 * Any wallet that already speaks SEP-43 — Freighter, Albedo, xBull, Lobstr,
 * the Stellar Wallets Kit, or a WalletConnect session — can be adapted to this
 * interface with a thin shim.
