# Automated Market Maker (AMM) Wrapper

The AMM Wrapper enables gasless token swaps on Soroban-based AMM contracts. By routing swap calls through Fluid, developers can sponsor transaction fee costs for their end-users.

## Capabilities

1. **Unsigned Transaction Construction**:
   - Generates the transaction payload (`xdr`) containing a Soroban `invokeHostFunction` invocation targeting the specified AMM's `swap` method.
2. **Gasless Fee Sponsorship**:
   - Sponsors the built transaction with Stellar fee payers using the standard fee-bump architecture.
3. **Soroban Preflight Integration**:
   - Integrates with the preflight pre-simulation steps to ensure the transaction will execute without reverting before signing.

## Endpoint
